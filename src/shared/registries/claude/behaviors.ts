// Anthropic Claude Code behavior statements — the implementation counterpart
// of contracts/vendors/claude-code.md § Repository vendor behavior and § User
// behavior.
//
// A statement says where Claude Code documents looking for a customization. It
// is not a filesystem matcher and can never authorize a read
// (contracts/inspection-path-allowlist.md § "Vendor locators are not
// Inspector matchers"); read authority lives only in the inspection-rule
// registry. Statements arrive with the inventory phase that needs them, so
// this catalog is closed but incomplete by design.
//
// Each statement is its own `export const` so a relation can name it directly.
// The keyed map at the end exists for the aggregate and for lookups by ID; it
// restates nothing.
// Each record is declared with `satisfies` rather than a type annotation, and
// the keyed map below uses `[RECORD.<id>]` as its key. An annotation would
// widen the ID to the whole closed union and the computed key would stop
// resolving to a property, which breaks the map's completeness check;
// `satisfies` keeps the literal, so the key cannot disagree with the record it
// points at.

 * `.claude/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`, with ancestor layers discovered at
 * startup and nested descendant skill directories discovered on demand as
 * files under them are accessed.
 *
 * The locator's one closed traversal field records the startup walk — upward,
 * terminating at the Git repository root. The documented lazy descendant
 * discovery is not a second traversal value: it is why the Inspector's rule
 * expands to descendant inventory, so neither half of the documented behavior
 * is lost.
