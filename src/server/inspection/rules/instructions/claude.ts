// Claude discovers instruction files per directory — the launch directory's at

// file there — so it is the one shipped product whose range comes from the
// path rather than from the Repository root, and that reading is this vendor's
// contract rather than anything shared.
//
// The base this unit extends is `../vendor/claude.ts` rather than
// `../claude.ts`, which holds this vendor's other kinds: both modules extend
// that base, and a base declared in either would have to be imported back by
// the other.
